# FastAPI Calculator API

This project is a basic API for performing arithmetic calculations using FastAPI. The API allows users to perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a single endpoint. Users can send requests with the desired operation and numbers, and the API will return the result in JSON format.

The API handles invalid operations and division by zero, providing appropriate error messages. It's designed to be easy to use, with an interactive documentation page available at /docs for testing the endpoints.
